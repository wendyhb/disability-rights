To-Do:

- rename most of the vague names like raw, raw_table, raw_clean into something that describes the data; e.g. protocol_raw for protocol data, or ptcl_raw
- rename 01_combine.R to 01_combine-non-crpd.R 
- 02_clean.R should only be for cleaning - not for exploring/finding regexes; this could be in 01.5_??.R
